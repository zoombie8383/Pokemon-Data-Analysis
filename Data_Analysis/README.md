# Pokemon-Data-Analysis

This package provides an implementation of Pokemon data analysis, which is referred from [Michael Metter's kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/mmetter/pokemon-data-analysis-tutorial/notebook). 
I implemented this project by using Jupyter notebook while practicing my python skills, and basic data analysis. The goal of this project is to understand the basic concept of data analysis including analyze the characteristics of the data set, search for the incomplete part of the data, add additional calculations to the dataset, and simply visualize our understandings. While having an interest in the pokemon universe before, these pokemon datasets inspired me to learn about data analysis and also learn more about the pokemon universe further.
I tried to follow the process of the Michael Metter's kernel, which includes a great job of data analysis with python. I also added some additional comments to each cells for detailed explanations of the code.
