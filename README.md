# **Pokemon-Data-Analysis**

## Overview

This package provides an implementation of Pokemon data analysis, whcih is referred from [Michael Metter's kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/mmetter/pokemon-data-analysis-tutorial/notebook). 
I implemented this kernel by using Jupyter notebook, practicing my python skills, and basic data analysis. The goal of this project is to understand the basic concept of data analysis including analyze the charatcteristics of the data set, search for the incomplete part of the data, add additional calculations to the dataset, and simply visualize our understanding. While having an interest in the pokemon universe before, these pokemon datasets inspired me to learn about data analysis and also learn more about the pokemon universe.
I tried to follow the process of the Michael Metter's kernel, which includes a great job of data analysis with python. I also added some additional comments to each cells for detailed explanations of the code.
